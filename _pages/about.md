I am a machine learning scientist at [Optum Labs](https://www.optumlabs.com). I recently completed my PhD in computer science at UCLA, advised by Professor [Eran Halperin](https://www.eranhalperingenomics.com). My research focus is the intersection of machine learning and medicine, leveraging electronic health records, physiological waveform signals, genomics, and medical imaging data. Additionally, I am interested in causal inference, graphical models, and imputation/missing data.

My industry experience includes a summer at Microsoft Research interning with [Daniel McDuff](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/damcduff/), four years as an intern at Intel under the mentorship of Gans Srinivasa, and three years as an engineer at [Omics Data Automation](https://omicsautomation.com) working with Gans. Prior to UCLA, I completed my degree in electrical and computer engineering from Oregon State University.
