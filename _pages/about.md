I am a computer science PhD candidate at UCLA, advised by Professor [Eran Halperin](https://www.eranhalperingenomics.com). My research focus is the intersection of machine learning and medicine, leveraging electronic health records, physiological waveform signals, genomics, and medical imaging data. Additionally, I am interested in causal inference, graphical models, and imputation/missing data.

Prior to UCLA, I received a degree in electrical and computer engineering from Oregon State University. My industry experience includes four years as an intern at Intel and three years as an engineer at [Omics Data Automation](https://omicsautomation.com), under the mentorship of Gans Srinivasa.
