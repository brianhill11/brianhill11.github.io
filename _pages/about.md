I am a computer science PhD student at UCLA, advised by Professor [Eran Halperin](https://www.eranhalperingenomics.com). My interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and medicine. Currently, our research leverages electronic health records, physiological waveform signals, genomics, and medical imaging data to predict adverse health outcomes. Additionally, I am interested in the standardization of data formats/interfaces for EHR systems and genomic data, and the development of infrastructure to facilitate big data analyses in precision medicine.

Prior to UCLA, I received a degree in electrical and computer engineering from Oregon State University. My industry experience includes four years as an intern at Intel and three years as an engineer at [Omics Data Automation](https://omicsautomation.com), under the mentorship of Gans Srinivasa.
