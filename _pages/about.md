I am a research scientist on the Machine Learning Research team at [Optum Labs](https://www.optumlabs.com). My research focus is the intersection of machine learning and medicine, leveraging electronic health records, physiological waveform signals, genomics, medical imaging data, and clinical text. Additionally, I am interested in causal inference, graphical models, imputation/missing data, and entrepreneurship. 

I recently completed my PhD in computer science at UCLA, advised by Professor [Eran Halperin](https://www.eranhalperingenomics.com).
My industry experience includes a summer at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/) interning with [Daniel McDuff](http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~djmcduff/), four years as an intern at Intel under the mentorship of [Gans Srinivasa](https://omicsautomation.com/team/gans-srinivasa/), and three years as an engineer at [Omics Data Automation](https://omicsautomation.com) working with Gans. Prior to UCLA, I completed my degree in electrical and computer engineering at Oregon State University.
